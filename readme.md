## 1 - Environment & WP Setup
1. Create project in Local by Flywheel. (Or clone a project from WP Engine).
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the parent folder of the WP root folder. (`app` in Local by Flywheel sites)
3. `git clone` this repo.
4. `rm -rf /wp-wc-start/.git` - Remove git folder from clone.
5. Move all files from the clone to your wordpress root folder. Ex: `rsync -av ./sc-wp-start/ ./WP-ROOT-DIR/`
6. `rm -rf /sc-wp-start/` - Remove clone folder.
7. `cd WP-ROOT-DIR` - Open project folder.
8. `composer install` - Install basic WP Plugins. (If you run into permissions problems skip those plugins by removing them from the `composer.json` file)

## 2 - Theme Setup
1. Search and replace all theme folder names, function name prefixes, etc, following the [_s Getting started](https://github.com/Automattic/_s#getting-started) steps.
2. `cd wp-content/themes/THEME-NAME`
3. `npm install`

### Add Wpack.io toolkit
1. `npx @wpackio/cli` - Might not be needed after `npm install` but in case it is.
2. `npm run bootstrap` and follow the guide. Set the URL to your Local site url. 

Note: For file watch and hot-reload to work properly the Router Mode in Local by Flywheel settings has to be set to localhost.


### Config wpack.io auto enqueue of JS and CSS files.
The [WPack.io auto enqueue](https://wpack.io/guides/getting-started/#mention-entry-points) function is already included in the `theme-setup.php` and should work out of the box for enqueuing both SASS and JS files.

All SASS and JS is devided by two entry points.
- `main.js` for all front-end assets.
- `editor.js` for all editro/admin side assets.

1. Take a look at the `wpackio.project.js` and update the project names.
2. Change the project name in the `\WPackio\Enqueue()` instantiation inside `theme-setup.php`


For more details about the WPack.io Auto Enqueue functionality see the [@wpackio/scripts Documentation »](https://wpack.io/guides/using-wpackio-enqueue/).


## 3 - Start Development
1. Make sure the Local by Flywheel environment is running.
2. `npm start` inside of the theme folder to start file watch and hot reload using WPack.io.

Note: For file watch and hot-reload to work properly the Router Mode in Local by Flywheel settings has to be set to localhost, and correct URL + port configgured in the `wpackio.server.js` proxy setting.
